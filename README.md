This project is an Basically an Replica of Amazon.in Home page. I have used HTML and CSS to create this project. 

Structure of the Project :-

1. This project includes a navigation bar positioned at the top of the page, resembling the navbar seen on Amazon.
2. The body of this project encompasses the main content area where product listings, descriptions, and other interactive elements are displayed.
3. Positioned at the bottom of the page, the footer serves as a navigational aid and may contain links to important sections such as help, contact, terms of service, and privacy policy.

Thankyou soo much :- Aditya Kumar Singh
